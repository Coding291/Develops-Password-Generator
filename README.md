# Developing-Password-Generator

* While developing the code for the password to generate we first created arrays and split method to store the values as constants and variables as a global variable so they can be accessed from anywhere.

* Next we created simple if statment followed by the prompt statements for the user to confirm whether they want to include certain criteria in their password.

* After user choose certain criteria, we use random numbers using Math.random function to generate all the elements in the criteria randomely.

* I also then added for loops inside of for loop, first loop to generate random characters and second for loop to put them together in one line

* After the answer is prompted, an alerts pops up stating the generated password.
